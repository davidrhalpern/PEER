# PEER Program Roadmap

## Purpose
This roadmap defines the maturity phases of PEER (Professional Enterprise Engagement Resource)
as a governance program. It exists to provide orientation, reduce drift, and support deliberate
progress without premature technical or institutional commitment.

This is a program roadmap, not a software delivery plan.

---

## Guiding Principles

- PEER is governance-first and implementation-second.
- Clarity, legitimacy, and institutional compatibility take priority over speed.
- Technical feasibility must be assessed honestly and iteratively.
- Later phases may be revised as understanding improves.
- Authoritative government documents (primarily PDFs) are treated as source material,
  not objects for automated interpretation.

This roadmap is authoritative unless explicitly updated via an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

---

## Current Status
**PEER is currently in late Phase 1 (Consolidation & Canonicalization), preparing to enter Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 1 — Consolidation & Canonicalization

### Objective
Turn accumulated insight, documents, and discussion into a single, coherent, authoritative
program foundation.

### Focus
- Clarity over completeness
- Consistency over speed
- Canonical definitions over exploration

### Milestones
- Canonical definition of PEER and its acronym
- PEER System Model designated as the conceptual architecture baseline
- Program origin and first principles documented
- Integration posture explicitly stated (how PEER integrates, not what it integrates with)
- Existing SAD material classified as:
  - conceptual baseline, or
  - future / deferred detail

### Exit Condition
PEER can be explained consistently, without contradiction, across documents and discussions.

---

## Phase 2 — Program Shape, Boundaries, and Feasibility

### Objective
Make PEER legible, non-threatening, and realistically feasible within institutional and
resource constraints.

### Focus
- Scope discipline
- Explicit non-goals
- Governance clarity
- Honest feasibility assessment

### Milestones

#### Program Shape & Boundaries
- PEER scope box defined (what PEER owns and explicitly does not own)
- Adoption entry models identified (e.g., pilot, shadow, manual / low-integration)
- Governance and ownership model articulated
- Non-goals explicitly stated to prevent scope creep

#### Feasibility & Resource Reality Check
- Order-of-magnitude feasibility assessment conducted
- Confirmation that PEER can be piloted by a small team
- Identification of:
  - capabilities that must be built
  - capabilities that must explicitly *not* be built
- Explicit recognition that PEER is PDF-first:
  - Government-issued PDFs are treated as authoritative reference artifacts
  - Obligations are human-adjudicated and anchored to document locations
  - Automated interpretation of policy text is out of scope for early phases

### Exit Condition
A stakeholder can ask:
- “Where does this live?”
- “How hard would this be to try?”
- “What does this intentionally avoid?”

…and receive clear, calm, and credible answers.

---

## Phase 3 — Credible Pilot Framing (Provisional)

### Objective
Make PEER realistically trialable without committing to full production software or deep
enterprise integration.

### Focus
- Safety to experiment
- Minimal commitment
- Learning over scale

### Milestones
- Minimum Viable PEER defined at a conceptual level
- Pilot constraints and assumptions documented
- Success signals identified
- Risks and mitigations explicitly named

### Exit Condition
A stakeholder can reasonably imagine authorizing a pilot.

> Note: Phase 3 assumptions may be revised based on insights gained in Phase 2.

---

## Phase 4 — Pitch-Ready Program Package (Provisional)

### Objective
Enable serious consideration, sponsorship, or adoption without overselling or premature
commitment.

### Focus
- Credibility
- Restraint
- Institutional trust

### Milestones
- Executive narrative (problem → insight → mechanism → safety)
- One-page program brief
- Supporting appendix (system model, SAD summary, governance posture)
- Explicit “What PEER Is Not” framing

### Exit Condition
PEER can be presented confidently without hype or defensiveness.

> Note: Phase 4 structure and materials are expected to evolve as the program matures.

---

## Revision Philosophy
PEER is expected to mature through learning. Revisions to later phases are a sign of increased
understanding, not failure. Changes should be deliberate, documented, and justified.
