# PEER Design Principles

## Human-Centered by Design

PEER intentionally preserves a human-in-the-loop model as a foundational design choice.

While technology enables scale and coordination, legitimacy, trust, and accountability in
government remain human-centered. PEER therefore prioritizes human judgment, human connection,
and human responsibility over automated interpretation or decision-making.

Automation within PEER, where present, is assistive rather than authoritative. Its role is to
surface information, reduce friction, and enable connection—not to replace policy judgment,
direct action, or render compliance determinations.

This principle exists to:
- build trust across agencies and roles,
- preserve organizational authority and discretion,
- enable meaningful peer-to-peer relationships,
- and ensure adoption precedes optimization.

Advanced automation may be introduced incrementally and deliberately, but only in ways that
reinforce human agency rather than obscure or override it.
