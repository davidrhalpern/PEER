# Pilot Assumptions

PEER’s pilot implementation reflects deliberate prioritization decisions made in the context of
limited initial resources and an emphasis on governance validity over technical optimization.

The following assumptions guided early design and implementation choices:

## Resource Reality
The initial phase of PEER is developed by a small core team, supported by modern tooling and AI
assistance. As such, early effort is focused on validating conceptual soundness, governance
mechanics, and adoption viability rather than exhaustive technical refinement.

## Human-Centered Priority
Where tradeoffs exist, PEER favors human adjudication, explicit responsibility, and mediated
interaction over automated interpretation. This reflects the belief that trust, legitimacy, and
organizational buy-in must precede automation.

## Sufficiency Over Precision
Early implementations prioritize “sufficient clarity” over perfect technical precision.
Mechanisms such as obligation anchoring and document referencing are designed to be accurate
enough to support governance workflows, with clear paths for later refinement.

## Deferred Optimization
Capabilities that are valuable but not essential to validating PEER’s core thesis—such as
advanced analytics, automation, or UI polish—are intentionally deferred until governance and
usage patterns are better understood.

## Non-Exhaustive Modeling
PEER does not attempt to model every organizational preference or workflow in early phases.
Flexibility and extensibility are favored over premature standardization.
