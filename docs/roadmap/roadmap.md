# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally lightweight and will evolve.

## Phase 0 — Program binder (current)
- Establish documentation structure
- Capture governance assumptions
- Define architecture at a high level
- Clarify product workflows and roles

## Phase 1 — Prototype (future)
- Minimal web UI for viewing documents and obligations
- Manual tagging workflow (“corn kernels”)
- Basic role assignment and messaging
- Unclassified reminders in conversation flows

## Phase 2 — Operational pilot (future)
- Admin dashboards
- Role confirmation workflows
- External document version awareness (manual review triggers)
- Reporting for leadership (adoption/assignment health indicators)
