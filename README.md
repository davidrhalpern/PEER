# PEER — Policy Execution, Evidence, and Responsibility

PEER is an unclassified program concept and software effort intended to turn finalized policy into practice by making roles, responsibilities, and obligations visible, traceable, and discussable after issuance.

PEER is designed to support accountability without assigning blame: it helps organizations see where delegation and follow-through are working — and where they naturally break down in large bureaucracies.
