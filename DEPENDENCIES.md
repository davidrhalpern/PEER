# Dependencies (Planned)

This document tracks major planned external libraries, frameworks, and services
that PEER may rely on in future implementation phases.

This is **not** a commitment to specific technologies — it exists to make
dependency thinking explicit and reviewable.

## Likely dependency categories

### Web framework
- Purpose: user interface and API
- Candidates: TBD

### Identity and authentication
- Purpose: user identity, role binding, access control
- Candidates: TBD

### Data storage
- Purpose: documents, obligations, roles, evidence
- Candidates: TBD

### Messaging / notifications
- Purpose: inquiries, reminders, role confirmations
- Candidates: TBD

### Visualization / reporting
- Purpose: dashboards and governance pulse
- Candidates: TBD

## Governance note
All dependency choices will be documented via decision records (ADRs)
before adoption.
